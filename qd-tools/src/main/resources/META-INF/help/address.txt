@article Address
To create a connection using any QDS tool one must specify an address.
Depending on an address format different message connectors are used to establish
connection.

To establish multiple simultaneous connections multiple addresses can be specified in one of two ways:
	(<address1>)(<address2>)...(<addressN>)
	<address1>/<address2>/.../<addressN>

The first way is preferred. The second way is legacy and is not recommended.

Every single address has the following format:
	[<filter>@]<address-itself>[<connector-properties>].

<filer> is used to configure data or subscription filter in message adapter factory
(see @link{filters}).

<connector-properties> is the list of initial properties passed to a
connector. They have a form of comma-separated list of pairs <key>=<value>
enclosed in square [...] or round (...) brackets. Multiple pairs of brackets
are also allowed, so [key1=val1,key2=val2] has the same meaning as
[key1=val1][key2=val2].

<address-itself> format depends on particular connector.

Available connectors are:

message connector use "Help <connector name>".
