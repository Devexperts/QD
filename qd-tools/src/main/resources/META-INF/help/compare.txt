@tool-summary

This tool compares two data sources and provides comparison information (about
data delays, dropped data percentage, etc.) to a screen and to MARS system.
It's general usage format is quite similar to Connect tool format (see
@link{Connect}).

An alternative data source to compare with is specified using --other-address,
--other-collector, and --other-record options which can be combined in arbitrary way.
At least one of these options must always be set. --stat option must always
be set as well.

--other-address option is used to set alternative address for second connection.

--other-collector option is used to set second connection collector type
different from the first one i.e. data gathered with different collectors can be
compared.

--other-record option is used to compare two different records. When it is
used the <records> parameter must consist only of one record. Both comparing
records must have equal number of both int and obj fields. If one wish to compare
two records with different fields but he is interested only in several specific
fields, he can combine this option and --fields option to handle only required
fields.

--alias option can be used to give some aliases to comparing sources. These aliases
are used to identify sources when logging a statistics to a screen or when passing
it into MARS system. The value of this option consists of two names (one name for each
data source) separated by slash ('/'). These names must not contain '=' and '.'
symbols (due to MARS nodes naming restrictions). In case this option is omitted data
sources are just called "1" and "2".

Every n seconds (where n is the value of --stat option) the tool logs two separate
statistics lines for each of two connections, starting with "(<alias1>)" and
"(<alias2>)" (just the same as Connect tool does), and one additional statistics
line of the following format:
	"=== Matched: <m> / Compare: Dropped <d1>% vs <d2>%; Delay <t1> ms vs <t2> ms
/ Unmatched buf: <u>"
@br;<m> shows the number of records matched in two sources, <d1> and <d2> show
percent of records that were received in one source and were dropped in the
other one, <t1> and <t2> show average delay of records in one source relative to
another, and <u> shows how much last records were received from one source
and stored in buffer in order to be possibly matched later.

Besides logging to a screen the Compare tool provides statistics into specified
MARS node. To use this feature one should define two additional JVM parameters
(using java -D option): "mars.node=<root-MARS-node>" and "mars.address=:<port>".
In this case there will be MARS subtree with all comparison statistics (similar
to one, that is logged to a screen) created inside the root node. Besides total
average statistics this subtree will contain separate statistics nodes for each
record and for each pair <record, symbol>. The whole subtree would have a
following format:
@br;
@br;<1>/<2>
@br;	|-<Record#1>
@br;	|   |-<SYMBOL#1>
@br;	|   |   |-delay_<1>     \
@br;	|   |   |-delay_<2>      |
@br;	|   |   |-dropped_<1>    |
@br;	|   |   |-dropped_<2>     > Statistics for pair
@br;	|   |   |-matched        | <Record#1, SYMBOL#1>
@br;	|   |   |-unmatched_<1>  |
@br;	|   |   |-unmatched_<2> /
@br;	|   |-<SYMBOL#2>
@br;	|   |   |- ...
@br;	|   |-...
@br;	|   |-<SYMBOL#M>
@br;	|   |   |- ...
@br;	|   |-delay_<1>      \
@br;	|   |-delay_<2>       |
@br;	|   |-dropped_<1>     |
@br;	|   |-dropped_<2>      > Statistics for
@br;	|   |-matched         | <Record#1>
@br;	|   |-unmatched_<1>   |
@br;	|   |-unmatched_<2>  /
@br;	|-<Record#2>
@br;	|   |- ...
@br;	|- ...
@br;	|-<Record#N>
@br;	|   |- ...
@br;	|-delay_<1>      \
@br;	|-delay_<2>       |
@br;	|-dropped_<1>     |
@br;	|-dropped_<2>      > Overall statistics
@br;	|-matched         |
@br;	|-unmatched_<1>   |
@br;	|-unmatched_<2>  /

Here:
@br;	- <1> and <2> are aliases for the first and the second data sources.
@br;	- delay_<i> is average data delay (in milliseconds) of the corresponding
data source.
@br;	- dropped_<i> is average percentage of dropped data in the source.
@br;	- matched is the number of matched records.
@br;	- unmatched_<i> is the number of records in the source left unmatched yet.

These statistics refers to last monitoring period only (as well the one that is
logged to a console). If some node values are undefined (e.g. if no records was
received during last monitoring period) they are presented as "N/A".

If some symbol names contain '.' or '=' characters (which is allowed) they will be
replaced by '_' and '-' characters correspondingly in the MARS tree.

If aliases are not set for the data sources then the root of a subtree will have a
name "compare" instead of "1/2" (or "compare1", "compare2", ... if several tools
run inside one JVM (see @link{Batch})).

Example:

	Compare somehost:7777 Trade MSFT,IBM -s 10 -A anotherhost:1234 -C stream
@br;This will compare Trade records about MSFT and IBM symbols received from
somehost:7777 with ticker subscription with same records received from
anotherhost:1234 with stream subscription, and generate statistics on these two
connections and on correspondence between them every 10 seconds.

Note, that the sample above supposes that the scheme is defined using JVM option
-Dscheme=<...>.
