It is possible to run several tools under one JVM. In order to do this one
can pass multiple tools initialization srtings separated by '+' sign. Each
executing tool receives its own parameters and options, but there are several
common options, that can be set only once (and would be available in all tools).
Such options are: -s|--stats, -l|--log, -h|--html-management and
-r|--rmi-management.

For example, it is possible to implement data delaying by running something
like: "java -jar -Dscheme=<...> qds-tools.jar Connect somehost:7777 SomeRecord
ASYMBOL --quiet --tape buffer~.dat[split=10m,storagetime=1h] --log log.txt +
Feed file:sample~.dat[start=-20m] :1234". This command will start Connect and
Feed tools running inside one JVM. Connect tool will tape data into buffer~.dat
files (where '~' is a timestamp), and Feed tool will read these files with 20
minute delay and send data to port 1234. Note, that both tools would use
log.txt to log information and errors (despite the fact that --log option was
set only in the first tool).
