@article File
@messageconnector-summary

File connector receives a URL of a file as an address and connects to it.
It supports the same file formats as --tape option of Connect tool
(see @link{tape}) and they are usually combined.

It can read and give out all the data presented in a file at once, or it
can also use ".time" files to reproduce original delays. By default it uses
these files if they present, but this can be disabled by setting
"ignoretime=true".

File connector also supports reading multiple timestamped files. If
filename contains special '~' marker, then it is replaced with a timestamp.
For example, address "file:records~.dat" means that we want to seek for
files like records20080320-154914+0030.dat and connect to them consecutively.
Corresponding ".time" files are also used in that case (if they exist).
