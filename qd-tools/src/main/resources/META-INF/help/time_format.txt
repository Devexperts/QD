@article Time format

Many QDS tools handle dates, times and periods as values of their arguments,
options or some input or output values. A common flexible format exists for
parsing and formatting date-times and time-periods and it is used almost
everywhere.

Dates and times can be parsed from one of the following forms:

	'-'<period>
@br;It is parsed as current system time - <period>. Description of acceptable
time-period format follows below.

	<value-in-milliseconds>
@br;This is a standart java representation of time as a single long number.
Value of msecs is measured from 1970-01-01. Here the value should be positive
and have at least 9 digits (otherwise it could not be distinguished from date
in format 'yyyyMMdd'). Each date since 1970-01-03 can be represented in this
form.

	<date>[('T'|'t'|'-'|' ')<time>][<timezone>]
@br;This is the most formal way to represent a date-time. If time is missing
it is supposed to be '00:00:00'.

	['T'|'t']<time>[<timezone>]
@br;In this case current date is used.

Here <date> is one of:
	yyyy-MM-dd
	yyyyMMdd
@br;<time> is one of:
	HH:mm:ss
	HHmmss
	HH:mm
	HHmm
	HH
@br;<timezone> is a timezone in RFC 822 format: <sign>hhmm (shift relatively to GMT
timezone). Some standart abbreviations, such as GMT, UTC, MSK, EDT etc. are also
acceptable.

Examples of valid date-times:
	2007-11-02-12:34:56
	20070101-123456
	2007-11-02-123456
	t12:34:56
	2005-12-31 21:00:00
	2007-11-02
	2007-12-12t123456
	20071212-12:34
	2007-12-12T12MSK
	20000101 2200
	01:01
	12:12:12 +0300
	-P1234DT12H30M0S
	-123456   // -period
	12		  // hh
	1234      // hhmm
	123456    // hhmmss
	20010101  // yyyymmdd
	123456789 // long
	12+1200
	1234+1234 // 12:34:00 +1234

The general format for time periods is based on ISO8601 duration format:
"P<d>DT<h>H<m>M<s>S" (which means a period of <d> days, <h> hours, <m> minutes,
<s> seconds) Also little simplifications and modifications available:
	* Letters are case insensitive.
	* Letters 'P' and 'T' can be omitted.
	* Letter 'S' can be also omitted. In this case last number will be supposed
to be seconds.
	* Number of seconds can be fractional. So it is possible to define duration
accurate within milliseconds.
	* Every part can be omitted. In this case it is supposed that it's value is
zero.

Examples of valid time-periods:
	P1234DT12H30M0S
    p1
    t239
    PT0S
   	1.5
    436243.2346
    1m
    1h2s
    p1dt
