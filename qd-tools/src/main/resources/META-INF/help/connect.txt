@article Connect
@tool-summary

This tool is used to connect to some address with specified subscription, and
log or tape received data. By default it just logs all received records to
a screen in text format (see @link{text format}).

There are two ways to define the subscription for this tool. One can either
define comma separated lists of records and symbols to subscribe for (and
date-time for history subscription also) or define an address to copy
subscription from. For example in the second case it can be an uplink address
of the server which we are connecting to. This way we can subscribe to all records
and symbols which this server subscribes by itself.

Note, that when defining <records> parameter one can use more complicated
filters than just a list of record names (see @link{filters}), but each pattern
filter (not depending on whether it starts with ':' or not) is considered to be
a record filter.

The main extra-functionality of the connect tool is taping data into file, which
can be performed using --tape option. (see @link{tape} for its detailed description
and samples).

Examples:

	Connect somehost:7777 Trade*,Quote MSFT,IBM
@br;This will connect to somehost:7777, subscribe to all records which names
starts with "Trade" and to record Quote about symbols MSFT and IBM using
ticker collector (which is default) and log received records to a screen.

	Connect somehost:7777 Trade*,Quote MSFT,IBM -q -tape quotes.log[time=text]
@br;This will do the same as the previous one except that it won't log records
to a screen but will tape them into file quotes.log (in binary format).

	Connect file:quotes.log Quote IBM
@br;This will connect to file quotes.log (created in previous example) and log
only Quote records about IBM symbol.

	Connect somehost:7777 somehost:7778
@br;If 7778 port is an uplink port of server somehost (i.e. it tries to get
record data from every connection and sends its subscription), then this command
will subscribe for everything that this server receives.

	Connect somehost:7777 Trade.Day GOOG 20080101 -c history
@br;This is the example of using history subscription (all Trade.Day records
about GOOG since the beginning of the year 2008).

Note, that samples above suppose that the scheme is defined using JVM option
-Dscheme=<...>.
