This tool multiplexes two addresses. It can be used to merge data from
several sources and provide it to multiple clients. All data providers connect
to <distributor-address> and all clients connect to <agent-address>.

Multiplexor creates a collector inside to store intermediate data (for all
types of subscription by default). Then every time it receives a subscription from
a client it stores it and also passes it to all of its data providers (connected
to a <distributor-address>). Then after it starts receiving required data from
providers it passes it to the client which subscribed on it. Thus, multiplexor
receives and stores only data that its client connections are interested in
(unlike Feed tool (see @link{Feed})).

Multiplexor also gives opportunities to delay data by specified period and
to drop some percent of data (by defining --delay and --drop options).

Note, that delaying data for long periods causes some problems. First, it
would consume lots of memory. Second, after some client subscribed on some new
record (and no other client was subscribed on it yet) it would start receiving
this records only after delay period. Even despite the fact that subscription
is passed immediately earlier instances of this record wouldn't present in
multiplexor's collector and the first one would be received after the moment
of subscription and stored for delay period.

Multiplexor tool (as well as Feed tool) can periodically dump records stored
in its collector to a file in order to restart without long gap in data flow in
case it was used to delay data and was restarted. The name of a storage file to
use can be defined by --file option. When it is set this file is automatically
loaded at startup. This option also allows to define filter of critical records
that must be dumped to this file. --write option defines how often to update the
storage file and must be used with the previous one.
