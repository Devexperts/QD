@tool-summary

This tool is used to post data from console to specific address. The data
is read in text format (see @link{text format}). Collector type headers
(==QD_TICKER_DATA, ==QD_STREAM_DATA, ==QD_HISTORY_DATA, ==QD_RAW_DATA) and
record descriptions (=<record> Symbol <fields>) are also supported, so one can
just redirect a data file in text format (for example, taped by connect tool
earlier) to an input of this tool, instead of typing records manually.
Default data format is QD_RAW_DATA.

Some additional commands besides common text format syntax are supported:
	?             - Shows commands usage summary.
	? *           - Lists all record names in data scheme.
	? <record>... - Lists fields for specified record(s).
	.             - Quits.
