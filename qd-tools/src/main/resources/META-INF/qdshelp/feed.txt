@tool-summary

This tool multiplexes two addresses. It is quite similar to Multiplexor tool
(see @link{Multiplexor}). Its main difference from multiplexor is the fact
that it uses wildcard stream subscription to its data providers (instead of
passing his clients' subscriptions each time). Thus, it always receives all data
and if some client subscribes for new record it would start receiving it
immediately even if the feed tool is working in delaying mode. On the other hand
it means that a lot of memory is consumed regardless of the number of client
connections and their subscriptions.

Also it doesn't support data dropping feature unlike multiplexor.
